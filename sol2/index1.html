        My life in my neighbourhood is rather calm because I don’t really know my neighbours.
       Sometimes I speak with them but it’s difficult. My neighbours are young and there is a high
       turnover in my block of flats. I like the ambiance of my street though. As long as I get on
      with my neighbours I’m happy. Lots of couple have young children so I do babysitting and it
      connects me both with the children and the parents. In front of my flat there is a park where
      ‘m near the forest and some shops. In fact my neighbourhood is cool and I like living here.
       I think I‘m not really in a community because I don’t share the life of my neighbourhood, and
      I not really participate in the activities of my neighbourhood unless they are really
      interesting.
